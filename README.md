# What is Git
- Verison Control System
	- Keep track of files
	- Keep history of every file
- Distributed
	- Works offline & online

---


# Installation & basic configuration

- Download the Git binary from git-scm.com (Windows)
- Set default credentials
```
$ git config --global user.name "Thibaut Vincent"
$ git config --global user.email thibautvincent@icloud.com
```

---

# GIT GUI's (not recommanded)
- Some very basic GUIS
- Other Git GUIs also exist
	- Windows: Sourcetree, TortoiseGit, SmartGit, etc.
	- OS X: Sourcetree, Tower (paid), etc.

---

# Repositories
- The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

- A git repository contains, among other things, the following:

	- A set of commit objects.
	- Branches

---

## Creating repository
### Start tracking files in a directory with
	$ git init

### Autocreation of `.git` folder
- Meta information
- History
- Hooks (pre-commit checking, etc)
- ...

---

#### Example
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in
/Users/thibautvincent/Projects/git-demo/.git/
```

---

# Remotes
- A repository can be synched with a server
	- In Git this is called a remote
	- A remote is identified by a name, defaulting to origin, and a URL
	- Keep a local copy in sync with the remote by pushing and pulling
	- Several users can push/pull to/from the same remote

---

## Add a remote

---

### If a local copy of a repository doesn't exist yet
A local copy of the master + the entire commit history is created

```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git clone git@github.com:thibautvincent/git-class-osoc.git
```

---

### If a local copy of a repository already exists
If the remote repository is empty, push your master to it
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:thibautvincent/git-class-osoc.git

thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git push origin master
```

---

## Push and pull
### Publish locally committed changes
	$ git push origin master

### Pull changes from the server
	$ git pull
    or
    $ git pull origin {branch}

---

# Branching
- The entire commit history can be visualized as a timeline
![](/Users/thibautvincent/Projects/git-class-osoc/branch-history.png)

- This timeline is also called a branch
![](/Users/thibautvincent/Projects/git-class-osoc/master-branch.png)

---

- Default branch `master`
- List all branches
	`$ git branch`
- Create other branches to develop experimental features
	`$ git branch this-is-my-new-branch`
    This is local. You have to push your new branch before anyone else can see it

- Activate (checkout) a branch
	`$ git checkout this-is-my-new-branch`


---

# Branching off
Create a new branch from another branch
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git branch
* master

thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git branch this-is-my-new-branch

thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git branch
  this-is-my-new-branch
* master

thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git checkout this-is-my-new-branch
Switched to branch 'this-is-my-new-branch'

```

---

## How does it looks like

---

## Publishing/pulling branches
### Publish a branch
	$ git push origin localbranch:remotebranch`
### Update remote branch list
	$ git remote update
### Fetch all remote branches
	$ git fetch origin

---

# Committing

---

## Creating a commit
- A commit saves a change
- Has a clear title that explains what happened
- Can have a body (mostly used to explain why change was made)

---

## Check the status
Git compares the current state to the last state stored in the history

```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git status
#
# Untracked files:
#	index.html
#
```

---

### Add files to your commit
Before creating a commit, you have to add changes

```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git add index.html
```

---

### After file is added
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git status
#
# Changes to be committed:
# (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   index.html
#
```
---

### Save your changes

	$ git commit

```sh

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines
# starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty
# message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be commited
# New file: index.html
#
```

---

### Add info to your commit
```sh
Creation of the homepage

This page will be the homepage of the site.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines
# starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty
# message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be commited
# New file: index.html
#
```

---

### Push commit
- Push new branch
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
```
- Push existing branch
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git push
```

---

### Result
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git commit
[master 0d2d4f2] Add title and body to commit
 1 file changed, 22 insertions(+)
```

---

# Flow visualization
![Flow visualization](/Users/thibautvincent/Projects/git-class-osoc/flowvisualization.png)

---

Only staged files are committed
```sh
thibaut in ~/Projects/git-class-osoc
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	flowvisualization.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

#### Change last commit
	git commit --amend
#### Write good commit messages
- English
- Present tense
### One commit is on change
- Don't fix bugs/ implement new features in 1 commit

---

### Patching
- `git add --patch` or `git add -p`
- Better control of what will be added to commit
- Make a habit of this one

---

### Added file by accident?
	git reset index.html

### Compare the current state with the previously committed state
	git diff index.html

---

## Head
- The head is a reference to a commit object. Mostly this will be the latest commit
- After every commit the head will change to the latest commit
